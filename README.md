# SimpleShell
_A basic linux shell._

A C program that serves as a shell (i.e. command-based interface) for Linux. The shell accepts user commands and executes each command using a separate process. In addition, the shell provides a history feature that allows users to access the recently-entered commands.

How to use history feature:
* When the user enters !!, the most recent command in the history is executed.
* When the user enters a single ! followed by an integer N, the Nth command in the history is executed.
